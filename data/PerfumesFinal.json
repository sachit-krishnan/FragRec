Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace"}, {"name": "La Nuit de l'Homme", "brand": "Yves Saint Laurent", "gender": "for men", "accords": {"aromatic": 100.0, "warm spicy": 86.2873, "lavender": 68.6996, "woody": 64.1064, "fresh spicy": 63.3381, "citrus": 49.1911}, "top": ["cardamom"], "mid": ["lavender", "virginia cedar", "bergamot"], "base": ["vetiver", "caraway"], "rating": 4.44, "votes": 16644, "longevity": "moderate", "sillage": "moderate", "value": "ok", "pic": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.5521.jpg", "description": "La Nuit de l'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent is a Woody Spicy fragrance for men.

Its accords expertly play against each other and they seduce the audience by being both elegant and daring at the same time.

This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2004 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007.Young and very modern American designer of Cuban origins Narciso Rodriguez has launched his first fragrances which has instantly become the hit in the US, and not only there. The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle.\nAt first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods \u2013 patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer.

While the pillar is an aromatic-foug\u00e8re, the new scent goes into a totally different direction with citrusy, spicy, woody, and ambery accords, described as \"cold and hot, sweet and spicy, light and shadow.\" The concept is based on an interpretation of passionate love, marketed as a fragrance for a \"strong, passionate, self-confident man who is deeply in touch with his emotions.\" Olivier Pescheux developed the composition as one of contrasts; the head notes are made to be vivacious and fresh with italian citruses, black pepper and rosemary. Pepperwood, geranium and rose facets are in the heart, before a warm base of woods, blended with tonka and vanilla. The advertising campaign is a modern interpretation of Canova's iconic \"Eros and Psyche\" sculpture, where a man embraces a woman played by Gigi Hadid and Salomon Diaz. The campaign is shot by Steven Meisel.

Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: \u201cI wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,\u201d Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director\u2019s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele\u2019s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.\nGucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom\u2019s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE SCENT:\u00a0 Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.\n\u00a0\nAuthenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.\nNotes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent\u2019s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine\u2019s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:\u00a0 An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance\u2019s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nA vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliqu\u00e9d with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.\n\u00a0 ABOUT CAMPAIGN:\u00a0 Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign\u2019s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci\u2019s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign\u2019s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden.

This is a new fragrance. M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. \u201cEverything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn\u2019t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nScent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now.\nFor a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.\nDisrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d\u2019une Odeur.\n\u201dThe musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,\u201d Alberto Morillas.\n\u201cI had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,\u201d Morillas said. \u201cNo one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.\u201d\nRoman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.\nIndian Coral Jasmine Nature Print \u00ae : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.\nAlessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.\n\u201cThe packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn\u2019t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nSymbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume\u2019s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto\u2019s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.\n\u201cThe guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a \u2018mythological\u2019 life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren\u2019t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nA gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle\u2014a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out.

Top notes are Aldehydes, Ylang-Ylang, Neroli, Lemon and Bergamot; middle notes are Rose, iris, Jasmine, Orris Root and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Civet, Sandalwood, Amber, Musk, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Patchouli and Vetiver. The famous Chanel N\u00b05 is a symbol of good taste and is currently one of the best selling perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel asked the perfume designer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume \u201cwhich smells like a woman\u201c. Chanel N\u00b05 is a very complex fragrance which does not allow any of the fragrant components to be isolated out of the composition, what was exactly a request of the great Chanel \u2013 the perfume should not smell like a rose, or a lily of the valley, but as a composition. The perfume became famous thanks to many celebrities who wore it, among which Marilyn Monroe. Chanel N\u00b05 is often connected to her name because during an interview in 1954 she said that in bed she wore only \u2018some drops of Chanel N\u00b05\\'. That statement became a superb advertising slogan and a reason for millions of women around the world to choose this perfume. Ernest Beaux created two series of perfume samples numbered 1-5 and 20-24 and asked Coco Chanel to choose one of them. Madame Chanel chose the sample no. 5 and thus the perfume got its name. Superstitious, Chanel presented her new perfume on the fifth day of the fifth month of 1921. Working on creation of this perfume, Ernest Beaux created and for the first time used the synthetic component \u2013 aldehydes. In his formula the aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, reminds of the odor of clean linen just brought in the house form the fresh frosty air. It is said that the famous creator drew his inspiration for creation of this fragrance from one of his visits to the Arctic Circle and the smell of water in midnight. The unique smell of frozen lakes and rivers fascinated him so much that he decided to replicate it in his creation. Chanel N\u00b05 is the first perfume in the floral-aldehyde group and the first by the quantity of aldehydes in its composition (another legend says that the Ernest Beaux\\'s assistant overdosed the aldehydes in the composition by mistake). The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, lemon, neroli and ylang-ylang, the heart of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and iris, while the base is created of vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, amber and patchouli. The first Chanel N\u00b05 was captured in a simple rectangular bottle with the top which resembled Place Vendome in Paris. The first bottle was designed by Chanel herself and represents her classical principle \u2013 less is more"}, {"name": "Tosca", "brand": "Tosca", "gender": "for women", "accords": {"citrus": 100.0, "yellow floral": 95.5476, "amber": 87.3738, "aldehydic": 76.626, "white floral": 74.9952, "fresh": 73.777, "woody": 70.6018, "sweet": 64.4243, "floral": 57.6455, "green": 55.7789}, "top": ["aldehydes", "bergamot", "orange", "neroli", "amalfi lemon"], "mid": ["ylang-ylang", "narcissus", "jasmine", "rose", "lily-of-the-valley"], "base": ["french labdanum", "amber", "vanilla", "patchouli"], "rating": 3.91, "votes": 212, "longevity": "long lasting", "sillage": "moderate", "value": "great value", "pic": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.5796.jpg", "description": "Tosca by Tosca is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women.

Carnal Flower was launched in 2005. The nose behind this fragrance is Dominique Ropion. Carnal Flower or forbidden flower is a fragrance with the scent of tuberose. Tuberose is a beautiful and dangerous flower. In some cultures, it is not allowed for young women to feel its intoxicating scent after sunset. Tuberose is a symbol of forbidden pleasure, hiding its passionate, sensual character behind its fresh, white, floral face. Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way. Frederic Malle was inspired for Carnal Flower during his visits to California, where everything smells like gardenia and tuberose. Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention. The muse for this perfume was Frederic Malle\u2019s aunt, famous actress Candice Bergen, who acted in the movie Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson. The top notes contain: bergamot, melon and eucalyptus.\nThe middle notes include: ylang-ylang, jasmine, tuberose, Salicylates (natural, toxic product of herbal origin, a sort of a herbal feromone which is used by plants as a warning).\nThe base encompasses: tuberose absolute, orange blossom absolute, coconut and musk.

After presenting more than successful fragrance for women, The One, Dolce&Gabbana house launched a fragrance for men named The One for Men at the begining of March 2008.

The notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:\"I like spicy-oriental notes and we\\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents\". Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top. The model of the fragrance advertising campaign will be the actor Matthew McConaughey, who will next week join the designers in the NYC. When it comes to the choice of the model, the Dolce&Gabbana designers said that they wanted to have the sexiest man on the planet. And with regards to that, Gabbana adds that this is the first time that a model in one of D&G men\\'s fragrance campaigns appears in clothes.

Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.\nFlacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.\n\nThe Notes of Fragrance\nAnne Flipo, B\u00e9atrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? \u201cIt was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This \u2018playful\u2019 aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Amber spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets\u201d.\n Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.\nWe can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true.

Womanity was launched in 2010. Womanity was created by Mane, Alexis Dadier and Ralf Schwieger. 18 years after Angel and 5 years after extraordinary Alien, Thierry Mugler is saluting femininity. The new edition will thrill all fans of his creations. It is named Womanity and it arrives in stores in mid-June 2010. Thierry Mugler with Womanity plans to launch (for the third time) a bestseller perfume and which will attract the public for years. Womanity is a word created to connect femininity, humanity and city. An overture to this edition began in March 2010 when Mugler launched Womanity.com web site with an idea that every woman cooperates in its creation and finishing touch. With an aim to create contents for the website, one story is finished by several women, each of them writing on her page. Contest asks women to give creative ideas for a particular project or cause. The winner will work with Mugler to finish the website. Fragrance WOMANITY was created as a part of this phenomenon, in a pink bottle. Connections between women are presented as chains and ring on top of the bottle which is decorated with metal frieze with symbolic design. Design of the top part of the bottle and beautiful frieze figures can be interpreted as Gothic or Art Deco style. Mugler's idea was however that the frieze encapsulated and depicted women of all generations. Composition of Womanity was created by Mane, as a powerful contrast of elements. By using the new molecular process of extraction, Mane manages to extract natural aromas of fig for sweet accords. Savory notes originate from caviar and the structure in ensured by fig wood aromas.

Her favorite scent is the scent of home, so she wanted a fragrance that will be a magical potion with that kind of smell. Mathilde Bijaoui created for her a composition of yellow tangerine, ginger, pumpkin, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, Grass rose, vetiver, heliotrope and musk.  It is available as 50 ml EDP. \"I have always located my favourite fragrances at the doorways of kitchens, in the heart of a greenhouse, at the bottom of a garden. Scent means place to me : place and state of mind - even state of grace. Certainly state of ease. My favourite smells are the smells of home, the experience of the reliable recognisable after the exotic adventure: the regular - natural - turn of the seasons, simplicity and softness after the duck and dive of definition in the wide, wide world.\n\nWhen Mathilde Bijaoui first asked me what my own favourite scent in a bottle might contain, I described a magic potion that I could carry with me wherever I went that would hold for me the fragrance - the spirit - of home. The warm ginger of new baking on a wood table, the immortelle of a fresh spring afternoon, the lazy sunshine of my grandfather's summer greenhouse, woodsmoke and the whisky peat of the Scottish Highlands after rain. I told her about a bottle of spirit, something very simple, to me : something almost indescribable, so personal it should be. The miracle is that Mathilde made it.\n\nThe great Sufi poet Rumi wrote :\n\nIf anyone wants to know what \"spirit\" is,\n\n\u2028or what \"God\u2019s fragrance\" means,\n\n\u2028lean your head toward him or her.\u2028\n\nKeep your face there close.\n\nLike this.\n\nThis is possibly my favourite poem of all time.\n\nIt restores me like the smoke/rain/gingerbread/ greenhouse my scent-sense is fed by. It is a poem about simplicity, about human-scaled miracles. About trust. About home.\n\nIn my fantasy there is a lost chapter of Alice in Wonderland - after the drink saying Drink Me, after the cake pleading Eat Me - where the adventuring, alien, Alice, way down the rabbit hole, far from the familiar and maybe somewhat homesick - comes upon a modest glass with a ginger stem reaching down into a pale golden scent that humbly suggests : Like This\u2026\"\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nComposition: Yellow tangerine, ginger, immortelle flower, Moroccan Neroli, Grasse rose, vetyver, heliotrope, musks..."}, {"name": "Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum", "brand": "Gucci", "gender": "for women", "accords": {"floral": 100.0, "citrus": 81.5409, "fresh": 76.057, "rose": 66.9933, "fruity": 62.0201, "woody": 57.0354, "soft spicy": 50.7294, "patchouli": 44.7696, "warm spicy": 44.6542}, "top": ["peony", "citruses", "mandarin orange"], "mid": ["osmanthus", "rose"], "base": ["sandalwood", "pink pepper", "patchouli"], "rating": 3.91, "votes": 2956, "longevity": "long lasting", "sillage": "strong", "value": "ok", "pic": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.7610.jpg", "description": "Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women.

JOY was created with a lot of care, just like the most expensive Haute-Cotture dress, and thus it was extraordinary and timeless. It was presented by Jean Patou as \\'the world\\'s most expensive perfume\\' right at the time of The Great Depression in 1929, when the market of luxury fashion crushed and Jean Patou\\'s house could survive only through the perfumes. JOY is created of rare flowers in unique concentration of 10600 flowers of jasmine and 28 dozens of roses which adorn the exceptional heart of this perfume. With the time JOY attains enormous success and became the second best selling perfume of all times (the first best-selling is the legendary Chanel N\u00b05). Intense and luscious with alluring floral composition, JOY was created by Henri Alm\u00e9ras, who made its top notes irresistibly delightful. The composition starts with fragrant jilt tuberose, luscious rose, ylang-ylang blossom, aldehydes, sweet and mouthwatering pear, and green notes. The heart beats passionately in pure and sweetly fresh jasmine notes, seductive and balmy spicy and darkened iris root. The base whiffs with sensual musk, warm and milky-powdery sandalwood, with mild musky civet tones.
